#### Supported Sensors

- temperature (&deg;F)
- humidity (Rh)

NOTE: Ideally the [SensorPush G1 WiFi Gateway](https://www.amazon.com/SensorPush-G1-WiFi-Gateway-Anywhere/dp/B01N17RWWV?tag=rynoshark-20) is used for continously collecting data from the sensors and publishing to the SensorPush cloud. However, SensorPush sensors can also synchronize historical data over Bluetooth when nearby using the iOS and Android apps).

## Installation

```
pip install pysensorpush
```
