# pysensorpush

Python implementation of the [SensorPush temperature and humidity sensors](https://www.amazon.com/SensorPush-Wireless-Thermometer-Hygrometer-Android/dp/B01AEQ9X9I?tag=rynoshark-20) cloud API. Requires the [SensorPush G1 WiFi Gateway](https://www.amazon.com/SensorPush-G1-WiFi-Gateway-Anywhere/dp/B01N17RWWV?tag=rynoshark-20) for continously collected data from the sensors (though can also synchronize historical data over Bluetooth when nearby using the iOS and Android apps).
